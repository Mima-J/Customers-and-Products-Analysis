# Customers-and-Products-Analysis
In this project, I used SQL to explore a company's sales database and provide data-driven answers to key business questions about inventory, customers, and marketing.

Project Story:

This guided SQL project aimed to conduct a comprehensive analysis of product performance and customer behavior to inform better business decisions. I used SQL queries to analyze sales, product, order and customer data, and I identified which products to prioritize (products that contribute most to revenue), focusing on the frequent and high-performing categories such as vintage cars and motorcycles. These findings indicated that strategic restocking efforts should prioritize these items to sustain and enhance profitability.


Furthermore, I used customer data to segment the clientele into the most engaged (VIP) and least engaged customers. This segmentation was to help tailor marketing and communication strategies to reward and retain high-value customers while finding creative ways to increase engagement among lower-tier customers. By calculating the average lifetime value (LTV) of customers at $39,039.59, I projected potential earnings and created a benchmark for budget allocation on customer acquisition efforts. This approach allows for strategic, data-driven decisions to foster growth and ensure profitability.
